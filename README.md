- 👋 Hi, I’m @Thauhir-06
- 👀 I’m interested in re-learning coding in general 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning The Odin Project(TOP), i try to learn about 1 hour/day (if my evening schedule is clear from commitments - slow progress is better than no progress)
- 💞️ Quote of the year - Slow and steady wins the race
- 📫 How to reach me - lilshiro13@gmail.com is my email, thats all for now
- ⚡ Fun fact: I also enjoy cars on the side line, mostly to drive, and i also re-built my PC from scratch, took 6 months of research to find what i needed before I made the purchase that was within my budget, can contact me if you want to know about my setup
